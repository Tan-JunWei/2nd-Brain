## Challenge Description
![[PicoCTF 2Warm.png]]

The challenge description instructs us to convert the number 42 to binary. We can use any online base 10 to base 2 conversion tool to do this. We can even do it manually. 

The number 42 in base 2 is `101010`. 

>[!faq] PicoCTF Hint: Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.
>
>We just have to wrap our answer with "`picoCTF{}`".

> [!NOTE] Flag
> picoCTF{101010}
