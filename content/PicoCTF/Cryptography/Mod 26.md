## Challenge Description

![[PicoCTF Mod 26.png]]

For this challenge, we do not need to download any files. We can copy the encrypted string `cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_Ncualgvd}` and head over to [[CyberChef]].

### The Flag

As the challenge description suggests, the string is encrypted using ROT13. So we use ROT13 to decrypt it.
