## Challenge Description

![[PicoCTF like1000.png]]

The challenge description implies that we will probably have to extract the contents of the provided `tar` file repeatedly until we finally find a flag. Let's explore.

### Understanding the challenge
![[PicoCTF like1000 2.png]]

We first download the provided `tar` file by running `wget <link>`. The downloaded file is named `1000.tar`. To extract tar files, I usually run the following command:

```bash
tar -xvf < file-name >
```

-  `-x` : Extracts files from a tar archive
-  `-v` : Verbosely list files processed
-  `-f` : Specifies archive file

After running `tar -xvf 1000.tar`, we can see that 2 files have been created (`999.tar` and `filler.txt`).

I thought that `filler.txt` may contain something useful or suspicious, but this was the contents in this file:

```
alkfdslkjf;lkjfdsa;lkjfdsa
```

It seems like there is nothing of interest currently. I proceeded to run the same command on `999.tar`, and received a similar output, in this case `998.tar`. I tried to `cat` the contents of `filler.txt` again, and the same gibberish was displayed.

However, since another `tar` file was created this time as well, it seemed like the solution to this challenge is to continue extracting the files again and again, one after the other.

### Attempting to solve
To do this, I made the following Python script:

>[!abstract] Python script 
>
>```python
>import tarfile
>
>def is_safe_tar(member, path):
>    return member 
>
>for i in range(998, 0, -1):
>    # Extract file
>    with tarfile.open(f'{i}.tar', 'r') as tar:
>        tar.extractall(path='.', filter=is_safe_tar)
>```
>
>>[!faq] Note
>>
>>The reason why is_safe_tar function was required is because there will be an error message displayed if a filter is not specified. This is aimed at preventing unsafe files from being extracted.

Running the script recursively extracts the existing `tar` files in the directory we are in. Running `ls` after successful execution of the script reveals that a file named `flag.png` created in this directory.

Opening this image file awards us with the flag for this challenge.
