## Challenge Description

![[PicoCTF Collaborative Development.png]]

From the challenge description, it is hinted that the "team" is facing some version control difficulties, possibly with Git. Other than this, we are not provided with any more clues.

Let's understand the challenge by first downloading the `challenge.zip` file using `wget`. Unzipping it extracts a directory `drop-in`, which contains a `git` repository within it.

### Git branches
![[PicoCTF Collaborative Development 3.png]]

I `cd` into the `drop-in` directory, and run `git init` to reinitialise the existing Git repository in this directory. 

Since the challenge is about collaborative development, I already had a feeling that we have to explore the different branches in the `git` repository.

Running `git branch -a` lists 4 different branches, namely `feature/part-1`, `feature/part-2`, `feature/part-3` and main, which we are currently on.

From my past experiences with Git, I know that we can run `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch to a different branch. 

I first switched to `feature/part-1`, and ran `ls` in this branch. There was a file named `flag.py` in this branch, and I proceeded to `cat` its contents, which displayed a part of what I expected to be the flag:

```
picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_
```

I suspected that the original flag was split into 3 parts, as there are 3 branches with similar names (`feature/part-1`, `feature/part-2` and `feature/part-3`) within this `git` repository.

### Piecing it together

Hence, I ran `git checkout` to switch to `feature/part-2` branch and checked the `flag.py` file, where I obtained the second part of the flag:

```
m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_
```

I repeated the same steps for the third branch, and found the third and final part of the flag:

```
w0rk_4c24302f}
```

We will be able to form the flag by piecing the 3 parts together.
