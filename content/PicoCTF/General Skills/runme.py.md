## Challenge Description

Alright, seems like we are given instructions on how we can solve this challenge. We shall check it out. 

### Acquiring the Flag

First, we download the python script using `wget <link>`. Next, I ran `cat runme.py` to check the script. I did not expect to get the flag so soon, but seems like we did! I did not even have to run the python script, as all the script does is print the flag (which I can already see).
