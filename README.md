# CTF Writeups
Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) writeup repository! Here you'll find detailed explanations and solutions to various CTF challenges I've tackled.

## Contents
-  **Challenges**: Organized by category (e.g., Forensics, Cryptography, OSINT, Web Exploitation), each challenge writeup includes a step-by-step guide on how to approach and solve the problem. These writeups cover the thought process, tools used, methodologies applied, and lessons learned.
-  **Useful Tools**: Feature some of the tools which came in handy when solving challenges
-  **Fundamental Knowledge**: Gives more in-depth, technical insights to important concepts that are required or beneficial for solving challenges

## Graph View Visualization
The **Graph View** provides an interactive way to explore the relationships between challenges, concepts, tools, and techniques. It offers a visual map that can help you see how different components are connected:
- **Circles (Nodes)**: Each circle represents a node, which can be a challenge, concept, tool, or technique.
- **Lines (Links)**: The lines between nodes present internal links, showcasing how these elements are interconnected. 
By using this visualization, you can gain a deeper understanding of the strategies used across multiple challenges, identify common tools or techniques, and explore how different concepts are interlinked.
