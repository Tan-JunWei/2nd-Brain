Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network (_What Is Wireshark and How to Use It | Cybersecurity | CompTIA_, n.d.).

  

Wireshark is the most frequently-used packet sniffer in the world. Like any other packet sniffer,

  

>[!important] Wireshark does three things:
>1. **Packet Capture:** Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic – quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
>  
>2. **Filtering:** Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
>  
>3.  **Visualization:** Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.
