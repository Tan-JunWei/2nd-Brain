## Challenge Description

![[Glory of the Garden.png]]

This is a very straightforward challenge. After downloading the file, I just ran `strings <file-name>`, and the flag was shown instantly. Since the flag was the last line displayed, I did not have to use `grep` as well.

### `Strings` example output
