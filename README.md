# CTF Writeups
Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) writeup repository! Here you'll find detailed explanations and solutions to various CTF challenges I've tackled.

> Click &#9733; if you like this project! Really appreciate it!

## Contents
-  **Challenges**: Organized by category (e.g., Forensics, Cryptography, OSINT, Web Exploitation), each challenge writeup includes a step-by-step guide on how to approach and solve the problem. These writeups cover the thought process, tools used, methodologies applied, and lessons learned.
-  **Useful Tools**: Highlights some of the tools that proved helpful in solving challenges. Note that only the most useful or commonly used tools are included in this section, not every tool used.
-  **Fundamental Knowledge**: Gives more in-depth, technical insights to important concepts that are required or beneficial for solving challenges. These are incorporated in the challenge writeups.
-  **Relevant resources**: Provides further explanations of the concepts, tools, or techniques used to solve challenges. If applicable, sources are linked at the bottom of each challenge for personal reading.

## Graph View Visualization

The **Graph View** provides an interactive way to explore the relationships between challenges, concepts, tools, and techniques. It offers a visual map that can help you see how different components are connected:
- **Circles (Nodes)**: Each circle represents a node, which can be a challenge, concept, tool, or tag. Tags allow easier navigation between similar challenges (E.g. Clicking the `#medium` tag allows you to browse challenges in that difficulty category.)
- **Lines (Links)**: The lines between nodes present internal links, showcasing how these elements are interconnected. 
By using this visualization, you can gain a deeper understanding of the strategies used across multiple challenges, identify common tools or techniques, and explore how different concepts are interlinked.

## The Ongoing Journey
As I continue to explore and glean deeper insights, this project will remain a living document, constantly evolving and improving. Regular updates will be made to refine the content, introduce fresh perspectives, and integrate the latest knowledge. Stay tuned for ongoing enhancements!
