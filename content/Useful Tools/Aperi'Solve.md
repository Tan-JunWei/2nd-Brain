>[!info] What is Aperi'Solve?
>Aperi'Solve is an online platform which performs layer analysis on image. The platform also uses [[zsteg]], [[Steghide]], `outguess`, `exiftool`, `binwalk`, `foremost` and `strings` for deeper steganography analysis. The platform supports the following images format: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `bmp`, `jfif`, `jpe`, `tiff`...

Aperi'Solve has been created in order to have an "easy to use" platform which performs common steganalysis tests such as LSB or `steghide`.
